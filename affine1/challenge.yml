  I found an encoded flag under his bed: `mtftio{rzp-lzsbihu...-mpi-icjb-jb-zser-cfeo-ich-bizur}`
  After hours of torture, he finally told me the key he used to encode it: `o = 5`
  Can you help me decode his secret?
hints:
  - Review the modular arithmetic video if you need to.
  - This is an **affine cipher**; look it up on wikipedia for some techniques.
