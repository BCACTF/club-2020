  We added a SQL injection detector! Good luck logging in now!

  [http://96.126.107.246:20014/2](http://96.126.107.246:20014/2)
hints:
  - How might the site be detecting your SQL injections?
  - Which symbols or phrases is it disallowing? How might you be able to tell?
  - What are some other symbols you could use?
