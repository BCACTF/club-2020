hints:
  - What's that public key doing?
  - You don't have the private key, so you can't generate a token... or can you?
  - What else can go in that `alg` field?
  - Head to [https://jwt.io](https://jwt.io) for an interactive token inspector, or use a Python library such as [pyjwt](https://pyjwt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
