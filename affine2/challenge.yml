  Only half the story??? After some fervent searching I found a hidden safe under a carpet.
  With my expert lockpicking skills, I extracted the second half of the secret `szlzou{xv-uyg-e-2yg-mz-fu-e-mek}`, but...
  Well, he was already dead, so I couldn't get the key.
  How can I decode this without knowing `o`?
  (The file is the same as before, so you don't need to re-download it.)
  (I **strongly discourage** using an online decoder for this, though they do exist.
  Reason through the modular arithmetic yourself, use hints if you need, and try to write code to discover the solution!)
hints:
  - Make sure you solve `A fine investigation` first
  - The flag format is `bcactf{flag}`
  - Review the modular arithmetic video if you need to.
  - This is an **affine cipher**; look it up on wikipedia for some techniques.
