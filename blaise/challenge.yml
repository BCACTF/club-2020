description: |-
  My buddy Blaise told me he learned about this cool cipher invented by a guy also named Blaise! Can you figure out what it says? Connect with `nc 2018shell2.picoctf.com 26039`

hints:
  - Look at the ciphertext, specifically one-letter words; does this look like a simple substitution cipher or something more complicated?
  - Think back to our vigenere attack example!
