  Time for a slightly different problem! Can you leak the PIN?

  Flag format is as follows: bcactf{*(12 digit pin)*}

  *Note that the column for the PIN is `pin`, not `password`.*

hints:
  - What information does the site return? How can you use that to leak the PIN, one part at a time?
  - What does `LIKE` do? How did we use it in the SQLi lecture?
