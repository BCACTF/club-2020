hints:
  - Yesreally Joe is looking at your message in a web browser.
  - What happens when you put HTML in the box?
  - What happens when you put JavaScript in the box?
  - It looks like Joe's keeping his cookies all to himself. Unless, you can get something to send it for you...
  - Have you tried looking at the `fetch` function?
  - You may want to use Hookbin again for this one.
  - Consider smuggling his cookies in the request body.
