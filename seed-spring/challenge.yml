  I finally managed to get that binary from picoCTF into Ghidra, which turned the executable into barely-readable C code. Can you help me solve the problem to find the flag? The flag format is picoCTF{...}
hints:
  - The problem is similar to "It's About Time"
  - Try renaming variables until things start making sense...
