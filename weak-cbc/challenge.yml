  I took this problem from a writeup for a CTF that no longer exists.
  I've tried to make it work but if there's any problems let me know.
  The source code doesn't *exactly* match the given file, but it's basically the same.
  I'm not gonna tell you where the flag is, either; try to get as much information as you can and eventually you should find it!
  If you need a hint, the first hint will tell you where the flag is.

  `nc 96.126.107.246 13489`
hints:
  - The flag is in the **keys**, so try to figure them out!
  - Notice that the keys are also being used as **Initialization Vectors**...
  - How can you figure out the IV? Should you use encryption, decryption, or both?
  - Draw out the diagram for CBC encryptors and decryptors...
