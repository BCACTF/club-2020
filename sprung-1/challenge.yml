description: |-
  To cope with increased infection risks, we've installed HEPA filters in our random number generators! They should keep out any Haphazardly Elucidative Pseudorandom Artifacts that might cause infection, or -- even worse -- allow a virus to guess our random numbers! That would be horrible. If our filter springs a leak, we're all doomed...
hints:
  - I don't randomly capitalize things, because that's annoying. What might sPRuNG mean?
