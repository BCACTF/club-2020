  Was turning my lights off not enough for you? How about accessing my camera?

  To make things easier, here's a bearer auth token you can use: `verysecuretoken`

  *This challenge and its intended solvepath are wholly unrelated to any hypothetical incidents that may have hypothetically occurred on any hypothetical server on a hypothetical service providing hypothetical text chats. If you're getting confused by all these hypotheticals, hypothetically seek a hypothetical medical professional.*
hints:
  - What's a *bearer token*? Is there a header where you can send it in?
  - Pay attention to the `Content-Type` header...
